# Dijkstra-shortest-path
This program takes as input set of obstacles represented as triangles, a start and target point. At the end of execution the shortest path between the starting point and the target is shown. The program provides a visual feedback by drawing the points, obstacles, and the path on the screen using the xlib interface.
